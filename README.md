Service to provide a single response from data sources using GraphQL and Apollo.

1. Dummy Apollo
2. Copy .env

5. Introspect BB






## Path '/graphql'

Apollo it's not flexible when defines which incoming path should listen. By default, receives all incoming request to port 4000. Adapt Apollo to receive only '/graphql' becomes into follow graphql-gateway pattern which becomes in less scalation flexibility.
